The data production usually occurs in conjunction with the development of the Environmental Planning Instrument (EPI) it is connected to. Original data inputs are produced by Local Government or the Department according to map and data standards developed by the Department and published externally via the website. These data inputs are checked by data and cartographic staff as well as planning staff internally against the map and data standards as well as for accurate content. Once the planning instrument is notified, the input data will be incorporated into the relevant EPI datasets. The quality management processes involved in the data production to this point are routinely screened by internal and external auditors for certification under ISO 9001 - Quality Management Systems. At this point the various datasets are then combined into a new normalised data schema to suit the requirements of the online Planning Viewer. This occurs via various automated ETL processes. Although every care is taken in ETL processes to maintain accuracy sometimes differences between inputs and final normalised data can occur.\r\n",

		"notes": "This dataset contains boundaries to which State Environmental Planning Policy (Koala Habitat Protection) 2019 applies to. The dataset contains three main layers. These layers are Land Application Map, Site Investigation Area for Koala Plans of Management Map and Koala Development Application Map. The description and method for these layers are detailed below.\r\n\r\nLand Application Map \r\n\r\nThis dataset applies to the whole of each local government area where Schedule 1 of the SEPP applies, in all areas where koala management area is specified. This policy does not apply to any land dedicated, reserved and or acquired under Part II of the National Parks and Wildlife act of 1974 or any land dedicated under the Forestry Act of 2012 as State forest or a flora reserve. \r\n\r\n\r\nSite Investigation Area for Koala Plans of Management Map\r\n\r\nThe Koala Habitat Information Base was used to develop a map that identifies areas that are likely to have koala use trees.\r\n\r\n - In 2018, the Department identified 137 koala tree species in a review of koala tree use across New South Wales.\r\n - In 2019, consultation with koala experts led to the list being refined to 123 species  in the Koala Habitat Information Base Technical Guide. \r\n - These 123 species were categorised into nine distinct regions, according to what koalas prefer to use in various areas. The number of species used regionally by koalas ranges from nine in the Riverina region to 65 in the Central Coast region.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map was restricted by the application of the SEPP, hence it only captures land in the LGAs listed in schedule 1 of the SEPP. The map also excludes the lands that the SEPP does not apply to, such national parks and state forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess for developing the Site Investigation Area Map\r\n\r\nThe Site Investigation Area Map was developed by excluding:\r\n\r\n - The LGAs where the SEPP does not apply (consistent with schedule 1 of the SEPP) \r\n - Land dedicated or reserved under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, or acquired under Part 11 of that Act (as set in clause 5 of the SEPP)\r\n - Land dedicated under the Forestry Act 1916 as a State forest or flora reserve (as set in clause 5 of the SEPP)\r\n - Cleared areas using the NSW Native Vegetation Extent 5m Raster v1.2 \u2013 the NSW Native Vegetation extent map provides a high precision surface that differentiates native tree cover from native grasslands, non-native areas, forestry plantation and water bodies \r\n - Areas that the Koala Habitat Information Base has identified as having a low probability of koala use trees. \r\n\r\n\r\nKoala Development Application Map for Eastern and Central NSW\r\n\r\nThe NSW Government\u2019s Koala Habitat Information Base was used to identify areas that have highly suitable koala habitat and that are likely to be occupied by koalas. \r\n\r\nThe map was restricted to the local government areas currently listed in schedule 1 of the SEPP. As the SEPP explicitly excludes national parks and state forests, these areas were excluded from the map.\r\n\r\nThe Development Application Map includes:\r\n\r\nAreas of the Koala Habitat Information Base\u2019s Koala Habitat Suitability Model that meet the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n - Highest quality koala habitat (class 1)\r\n - Highly suitable koala habitat (class 2) that is likely to be occupied by koalas; and\r\n - Provides critical connectivity between class 1 and class 2 habitat in fragmented landscapes (this was applied in regions other than the North Coast). In this regard, it identifies the most preferred vegetation that a koala would use to move between highly suitable patches of habitat\r\n\r\nExcludes:\r\n\r\n - All areas of class 2 habitat where the data shows koalas are not likely to occur \r\n - The LGAs where the SEPP does not apply (consistent with Appendix 1 of the SEPP)\r\n - Land dedicated or reserved under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 or acquired under Part 11 of that Act (as set in clause 5 of the SEPP)\r\n - Land dedicated under the Forestry Act 1916 as a State forest or flora reserve (as set in clause 5 of the SEPP)\r\n - Cleared areas using the NSW Native Vegetation 5m raster v1.2 \u2013 the NSW Native Vegetation extent map provides a high precision surface that differentiates native tree cover from native grasslands, non-native areas, forestry plantation and water bodies \r\n\r\n\r\nKoala Development Application Map for Western NSW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Development Application map uses data from the NSW Government\u2019s Koala Habitat Information Base to identify areas of highly suitable koala habitat. Unlike Eastern NSW, occupancy predictions were not utilised due to the scarcity of survey records. The extent of suitable habitat in this harsher environment was modelled with records across the koala\u2019s whole eastern Australian range and referenced temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration and soil variables.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Development Application map is restricted to the local government areas listed in schedule 1 of the SEPP (i.e. it only captures the local government areas where the SEPP applies). As the SEPP explicitly excludes national parks and state forests, these areas are also excluded from the map.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Development Application Map for Western NSW applies to the following local government areas (LGAs):\r\n\r\n\r\nBerrigan\r\nBourke \r\nBrewarrina\r\nCentral Darling \r\nCoonamble\r\nEdward River\r\nFederation\r\nForbes\r\nGreater Hume Shire\r\nLockhart\r\nMurray River\r\nNarrandera\r\nNarromine\r\nParkes\r\nWagga Wagga\r\nWalgett\r\nWarren\r\nWeddin \r\nWentworth\r\n\r\nIncludes:\r\n\r\nAreas of the Koala Habitat Information Base\u2019s Koala Habitat Suitability Model that meet the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Two highest quality koala habitat classes in the western division\r\n\r\nExcludes:\r\n\r\n\r\n - Areas that have unsuitable vegetation in the Darling Riverina Plains and the Riverina Koala Modelling Regions (KMR) as identified by the Koala Tree Species Index \r\n- Areas of unsuitable vegetation in the Far West KMR as identified using a modified Koala Tree Species Index that favoured riverine koala tree use species.\r\n - The LGAs where the SEPP does not apply (consistent with Appendix 1 of the SEPP)\r\n- Land dedicated or reserved under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 or acquired under Part 11 of that Act (as set in clause 5 of the SEPP)\r\n- Land dedicated under the Forestry Act 1916 as a State forest or flora reserve (as set in clause 5 of the SEPP)\r\n- Cleared areas using the NSW Native Vegetation 5m raster v1.2 \u2013 the NSW Native Vegetation extent map provides a high precision surface that differentiates native tree cover from native grasslands, non-native areas, forestry plantation and water bodies \r\n\r\n\r\n",
