  h1 Counting Koalas
  p Counting Koalas is tricky business. With subpopulations so varied, sparse, and non-uniformly distributed across the state, observations in one area cannot be generalised to others. Data and collection methods are not yet standardised, leaving any estimates of total population with a big caveat of uncertainty.

  p Finding absolute koalas numbers isnâ€™t pragmatic, nor is it overly insightful. Top ecologists instead prefer to look at the

    span.italic Area of Occupancy

    p Lacking updated research, many inquiry submissions referred to 
      +link("a study", "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ddi.12400")
      |  which estimated 36,000 NSW koalas as of 2012 &ndash; a 26% decrease on ~1994. The study projected a similar decrease for the next two decades.*

  //.italic.text-xl [The area of occupancy's] decline is so fast ... it does not matter whether you have 5k, 10k, or 50k, it warrants recognition of this animal as endangered at a State level already.
