        p The Coffs Harbour hinterland is koala country — over 40% of all koala hubs in NSW are here. The proposed Great Koala National Park would protect 175K ha of state forest, creating an expansive and connected area designed for tourism and koala conservation.
        p The Park would encompass 315K ha in total (converted state forests combined with 140K ha of existing national park) and include numerous walking trails, a 215km hiking track, a 65km horseback trail, and an extensive mountain bike network.
        p The proposal has been co-created and endorsed by the local Gumbaynggiru people. Due to the area’s size and environmental diversity, the Great Koala National Park gives NSW koalas their best hope at climate adaptation.
