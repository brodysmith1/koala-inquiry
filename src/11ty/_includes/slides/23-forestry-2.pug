    p In the coming days, the University of Newcastle will publish the first comprehensive economic assessment of the Great Koala National Park. It will include a cost-benefit analysis of the Park, including a jobs assessment. 

    p 
      | When published, we will be able to compare the net present value of timber production to the Great Koala National Park. A simplified 
      +link('"back of the envelope" calculation','https://coffscoastoutlook.com.au/?p=29973')
      |  estimates the Park to contribute $300M to the state economy per year — tipping the $292M added by the local timber industry (according to the AFPA assessment).
    
  
  //  p In both reports, the economic models are based on assumptions unsuited to the Great Koala National Park proposal. 
    
    p Both models use a similar region of impact — the North-East Regional Fire Agreement area — which is over five times larger than that of the proposed Great Koala National Park. Both models assume all logging across this expanded region stops completely, overestimating the scale of protections and ignoring production and employment from continued logging nearby.
    
    p Further, the FWPA report assumes no increase in tourism, visitor spending, or additional job creation in converting state forest to national park. The Great Koala National Park is designed for tourism.

    p.footnote(style="max-width: inherit") Note: NSW Forestry Corp opposed the GKNP on economic grounds. However, in the inquiry report, they were criticised for being an irresponsible corporate citizen; receiving 245 non-compliances in 2014-15 alone. Immediately after the 2019-20 bushfires, they salvage logged south-coast forests before damage could be assessed and new protections introduced.
