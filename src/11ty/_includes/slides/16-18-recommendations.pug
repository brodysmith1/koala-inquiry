        p Recommendations 5 and 41 are most alike in this group — that the NSW Government create a Georges River Koala National Park (5) … and that they investigate the establishment of the Great Koala National Park (41).

        p Strategically converting state forest to national park will protect large areas of connected koala habitat forever. And, because private landholders are less affected, it’s a simpler legislative process. The government can adopt these recommendations fast, without burning through state resources.

        p In the following slides, we look at the arguments for and against the establishment of these parks.
